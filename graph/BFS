# tree and graph
tree: n finite nodes with hierarchical relationships
graph: (V, E), V is non empty finite set of nodes and E is set of edges
- edge weights

Two ways of implementing graph:
1. adjacency matrix: two dim array stores the adjaceny relationships between certices
2. adjacent table: a vertex table and an edge table
E.g.:
1: 5(8)
2: 5(6)
3: 4(10) --> 5(2)
...

Codes:
Python:
```
# adjacency matrix
matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
for e in edges:
  u, v = e[0], e[1]
  matrix[u][v] = 1
  matrix[v][u] = 1
print(matrix)

# adjacency table
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
for e in edges:
  u, v = e[0], e[1]
  graph[u].append(v)
  graph[v].append(u)
print(graph)
```

Breadth-First Search: always search for states that are close to the initial state first
