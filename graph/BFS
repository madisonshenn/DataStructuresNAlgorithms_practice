# tree and graph
tree: n finite nodes with hierarchical relationships
graph: (V, E), V is non empty finite set of nodes and E is set of edges
- edge weights

Two ways of implementing graph:
1. adjacency matrix: two dim array stores the adjaceny relationships between certices
2. adjacent table: a vertex table and an edge table
E.g.:
1: 5(8)
2: 5(6)
3: 4(10) --> 5(2)
...

Codes:
Python:
```
# adjacency matrix

# adjacency table

```

# BFS
Breadth-First Search
