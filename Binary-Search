# Binary Search

#### 74. Search a 2D Matrix


#### Follow up: 240. Search a 2D Matrix 2


## binary search on special arrays
special arrays:
1. rotated sorted array
2. find peak
#### 154. Find Minimum in rotated sorted array 2
If nums[mid] > numbs[end], min is at left of the mid, so left = mid + 1.
If nums[mid] < numbs[end], min is either mid or at the right of the mid, so right = mid.
If nums[mid] == numbs[end], we dont know, right = right - 1.

#### 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
1. find mid
2. nums[mid] vs target
3. [left, mid - 1] [mid + 1, right]

#### 162. Find Peak Element

#### 1901. Find Peak Element 2
Find max per row or col, and check which of those max is the peak.
