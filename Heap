# Heap
for implementing priority queue
usecase: repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority
Heap in python:
heapq
x = [1,2,3,4,5] # list
heapify(x)
x[0] # min in the heap x
heappop(x) # pop the min
heappush(x, val) # insert val into heap
delete elements from heap:
x.remove(val)
heapify(x)

#### 75. Sort Colors
Given a list of int, sort it from small to large.
```
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        heapify(nums)
        newList = []
        while nums:
            newList.append(heappop(nums))
        nums[:] = newList[:]
```
#### 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
```
class Kthlargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.heap = nums
        self.k = k
        heapq.heapify(nums)
        while len(nums) > k:
            heapq.heappop(nums)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, val)
        if len(self.heap) > self.k:
          heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        return self.heap[0]
```

#### Minimum Cost to Hire K Workders
There are n workers. You are given two integer
arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.

We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
1.Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
2.Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.

Example: 
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.

```
# sort by wage/quality
# use heap to keep min k quality

```
